# Gym Member Exercise Analysis

## Abstract
This study analyzes a Kaggle fitness dataset to uncover trends in age, workout habits, calories burned, and water intake. Key analyses focus on identifying the oldest participants for each gender, examining fitness patterns in individuals over 50, and exploring calorie burn across different workout types. Visualizations illustrate relationships between water intake, workout duration, calories burned, and BMI by experience level. The findings reveal valuable insights into how workout choices, experience, and demographics influence fitness outcomes, providing a deeper understanding of fitness behaviors across various groups.

## Introduction 
With increasing interest in personal fitness, datasets that capture health metrics like age, workout type, calories burned, and water intake offer valuable opportunities for analysis. This study uses a gym members exercise dataset to explore following:
  1. Max Age for each Gender
  2. Max calorie burned for every workout type
  3. A bar chat on water intake vs workout type differenciated by gender
  4. Scatter plot for calories burned vs session duration for all workout types - the same plot was made for people of age over 50
  5. Boxplot for bmi by exprience level
  6. A heatmap for correlations coefficients between all numeric columns in datset 

## Conclusion
This analysis reveals intriguing trends in fitness behavior. Both genders share the same maximum age of 59, and strength workouts lead to the highest calorie burn, while yoga burns the least. Water intake is highest during HIIT, with males drinking more than females. Longer workouts generally burn more calories, but HIIT stands out for its high calorie burn in shorter sessions. Additionally, BMI decreases with experience, suggesting better fitness levels in more seasoned individuals.
